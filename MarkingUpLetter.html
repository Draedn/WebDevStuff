    <h3>Re: Eileen Dover University Application</h3>

    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your
        <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

    <h4>Starting Dates</h4>
    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time. However, it would suit us better if you could start at
        the beginning of a semester:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please let me know if this is okay, and if so, which start date you would prefer. You can find more information about important
        university dates on our <a href="http://example.com" title="University of Awesome Important Dates">website</a>.</p>

    <h4>Subjects of Study</h4>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the
        realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to
        have on our team. Of the ideas you submitted, we were most intrigued by the following, in order of priority:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size
            exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
        <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Please provide more information on each of these subjects, including expected research duration, required staff and other
        resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know. Thanks.</p>

    <h4>Exotic Dance Moves</h4>
    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favorite
        dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Polynesian Chicken Dance:</strong> A little-known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300 BC. A whole
            village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</li>
        <li><strong>Icelandic Brownian Shuffle:</strong> Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to
            practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around
            in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired
            modern styles such as Twerking.</li>
        <li><strong>Arctic Robot Dance:</strong> An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s
            believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by
            inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on, however, it was discovered that they were just moving like this
            because they were really cold.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For more of my research, see my <a href="http://example.com" title="Dr. Eleanor Gaye's Exotic Dance Research Page">exotic
            dance research page</a>.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely,<br>
        <strong>Dr. Eleanor Gaye</strong></p>
